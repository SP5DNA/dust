//! Session scoring, the way RufzXP scores a callsign, with what copying groups
//! adds to it.
//!
//! RufzXP's manual describes its points without publishing the formula: the
//! most a call can earn grows with the square of the speed and with the
//! length of the call; every error cuts what is left hard — one error to a
//! quarter, two to a ninth, three to a sixteenth; hearing the call again
//! costs half; and the time taken to type it comes off logarithmically. Each
//! group here is scored that way — what is known of the rules, in a form of
//! our own — and a session is what its groups earn, added up.
//!
//! Two things RufzXP has no need of, here do the work it leaves to the
//! callsigns themselves. A callsign is drawn from the whole alphabet; a group
//! may be drawn from two Koch letters, and copying one of two is far less
//! than copying one of twenty-six. So every character is worth what it
//! tells you — `log₂` of how many it could have been — against a character
//! of the full alphabet. And a group may be sent with Farnsworth spacing,
//! its characters fast and the gaps between them long, so its speed is the
//! two speeds together.
