//! What a player has to rebuild when the settings move, as a value it can
//! compare.
//!
//! The band — its noise, its static, its stations, the receiver they are
//! heard through and the AGC riding them — is a running generator, built at
//! random: building it again is a new band, and costs the knee's measurement.
//! The fading is not part of it: it is applied to the Morse alone, a send at a
//! time ([`super::Qsb`]), so moving the fading never touches the band.
