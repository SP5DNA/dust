//! What arrives at the antenna before the receiver has shaped it: the noise
//! floor and atmospheric static.
//!
//! Both are *excitation*. Neither has a pitch of its own — the noise floor is
//! white and a sferic is an impulse — and both become what an operator hears
//! only once the receiver's filter has had them. The floor comes out as a
//! steady hiss pitched at the filter's centre; each sferic comes out as the
//! filter's own impulse response, a short tick that rings at the same pitch.
//! That shared filter is what makes a band sound like a band.
//!
//! Levels are absolute, in units of the station you are copying: a floor is
//! set by its signal-to-noise ratio in a [`REFERENCE_BANDWIDTH_HZ`] filter,
//! and a sferic by how far its peak through that filter stands above the
//! reference floor ([`super::calibration`]). Everything is scaled by the
//! sample rate so a band sounds the same at 44.1 kHz as at 48 kHz.
//!
//! One noise here comes in after the receiver rather than before it: the
//! [`AudioFloor`], the faint wide hiss of the receiver's own audio stage,
//! which the filter never touches.
