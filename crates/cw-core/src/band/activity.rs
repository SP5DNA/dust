//! Other stations on the band.
//!
//! A real CW segment is never empty. Behind the station you are copying there
//! is faint Morse at other pitches and speeds, coming and going, now and then
//! a steady carrier. Without it a background is a noise generator — which is
//! what the ear hears as wind.
//!
//! Like the noise floor and the static, the stations here are excitation:
//! tones at their own audio pitch, summed in before the receiver's filter. The
//! filter then does to them exactly what it does to a real band — a station
//! inside the passband comes through, one beside it is pushed down by the
//! skirt, and widening the filter lets more of them in. The AGC and the
//! browser's stream get them for nothing, because they ride the same source.
//!
//! Everything is calibrated against off-air recordings of the 20 m CW band
//! (KiwiSDR, Hermes-Lite 2 and contest captures), measured the way an
//! operator would hear them through a 500 Hz filter — this receiver's old
//! default, sharp and 500 Hz wide at 3 dB. A narrower receiver hears less of
//! the same band, as a real one does:
//!
//! - **How busy.** Another station is audible in 0.12-0.53 of all one-second
//!   stretches across the recordings, and inside the passband itself in
//!   0.10-0.30 of them; tuned to random spots, the seven recordings average
//!   0.44. With one other station allowed to call, the band here sits at
//!   about 0.3, in the middle of that; with the most, at a contest's 0.5-0.7.
//!   That is 0.3-0.6 stations transmitting per kHz at once on a normal band,
//!   about 0.8 in a contest.
//! - **How loud.** Per 5.86 Hz analysis bin, over the noise in that bin: a
//!   median of about 22 dB with a spread of 9 dB, from barely there to 50 dB.
//!   Contest stations run about 8 dB louder.
//! - **What they send.** Almost all of it is keyed CW — CQ calls, callsigns,
//!   reports, "TU" and "73" — at a median of 22-25 WPM (17 to 38 between the
//!   10th and 90th percentiles), with dahs three dits long give or take. A
//!   station sends one to three overs of a few seconds each, a few seconds
//!   apart, at the same pitch, fading on its own path as it goes. One in ten
//!   drifts; one in ten is hard-keyed, and clicks through the filter's skirt.
//! - **What else.** Steady carriers are rare: about 0.07 per kHz, so one lands
//!   within 700 Hz of your pitch in roughly one session in ten. Most are local
//!   birdies, steady and faint; the rest are transmitted carriers, loud and
//!   fading, and some of those go away again. Very occasionally something
//!   sweeps across the band in under a second.
//!
//! How many of them there are is the same setting as the pile-up: "stations
//! calling at once". At one — just the station you are copying — the band is
//! empty. Above that, never more than the rest of that count are keying at
//! once within earshot of the filter, and a pile-up's callers come out of the
//! same count while they call: a station whose turn comes when the band is
//! full waits for a gap, the way an operator waits for a clear moment. The
//! more that may call, the busier the band, from an ordinary evening at two
//! to a contest at the top.
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do is crowd the station you are copying. This
//! is a trainer: inside that station's pitch range nothing else is allowed
//! within 6 dB of it, and no carrier within 10 dB.
//!
//! Allocation-free per sample: a fixed pool of transmitters, and all the text
//! they send encoded once, when the band is built.
