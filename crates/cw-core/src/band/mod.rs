//! The band: what a receiver in CW mode hears around the station you are
//! copying, shared by every backend.
//!
//! The names mean what an operator means by them. The noise floor is the
//! steady hiss of the band itself. QRN is atmospheric static — lightning. QSB
//! is fading. QRM, another station on top of yours, lives with the stations
//! rather than in here.
//!
//! The model follows the signal chain of a real receiver, because that is
//! where the sound comes from:
//!
//! 1. The band puts white Gaussian noise and impulsive static into the
//!    antenna ([`noise`]). Neither has a pitch.
//! 2. Everything passes through one CW filter ([`filter`]), the Morse
//!    included. That filter is what gives the hiss its pitch and width and
//!    makes every crash and every dit ring; narrowing it quiets the band,
//!    pushes off-frequency stations down and lengthens the ringing, all at
//!    once, because those are one thing.
//! 3. The AGC rides the gain ([`agc`]): a steady few decibels down under a
//!    keyed station, back up in the pauses, and only a moment's duck for a
//!    crash.
//! 4. The receiver's audio stage adds a faint, wide hiss of its own
//!    ([`AudioFloor`]), after the filter and the AGC, so the band is never
//!    quite silent outside the passband — as no real receiver is.
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do is invent a sound the receiver would not
//! make. An earlier model fed sparse clicks into resonators a few hertz wide
//! and swept their tuning, which is how a wind-whistle is synthesised, and it
//! sounded like one. A real CW filter is hundreds of hertz wide, sits still,
//! and is fed with continuous noise; this is that.
