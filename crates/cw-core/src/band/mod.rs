//! The band: what a receiver in CW mode hears around the station you are
//! copying, shared by every backend.
//!
//! The names mean what an operator means by them. The noise floor is the
//! steady hiss of the band itself. QRN is atmospheric static — lightning. QSB
//! is fading. QRM, another station on top of yours, lives with the stations
//! rather than in here.
//!
//! The model follows the signal chain of a real receiver, because that is
//! where the sound comes from:
//!
//! 1. The band puts white Gaussian noise, impulsive static and other
//!    stations into the antenna ([`BandSource`]). Only the stations have a
//!    pitch.
//! 2. Everything passes through one CW filter ([`FilterDesign`]), the Morse
//!    included. That filter is what gives the hiss its pitch and width and
//!    makes every crash and every dit ring; narrowing it quiets the band,
//!    pushes off-frequency stations down and lengthens the ringing, all at
//!    once, because those are one thing.
//! 3. The AGC rides the gain: a steady few decibels down under a keyed
//!    station, back up in the pauses, and only a moment's duck for a crash.
//!    Its knee is set from the band's own floor ([`agc_knee`]).
//! 4. The receiver's audio stage adds a very faint, wide hiss of its own
//!    ([`AudioFloor`]), after the filter and the AGC, so the band is never
//!    quite silent outside the passband — as no real receiver is.
//! 5. A soft limiter ([`soft_limit`]) catches whatever is still too loud,
//!    once, on everything the player is about to play.
//!
//! QSB is applied to the Morse alone ([`Qsb`]): fading is a property of the
//! path a station arrives on, not of the noise around it.
//!
//! What it deliberately does not do is invent a sound the receiver would not
//! make. Sparse clicks through resonators a few hertz wide, their tuning
//! swept about, is how a wind-whistle is synthesised. A real CW filter is
//! hundreds of hertz wide, sits still, and is fed with continuous noise; this
//! is that.
