//! The receiver's automatic gain control.
//!
//! One static law, shared by both backends: below a fixed knee the gain is
//! left alone, and above it the gain comes down half a decibel for every
//! decibel of excess, never more than [`AGC_MAX_DUCK_DB`]. The native player
//! runs that law sample by sample in [`Agc`], with a hang; the browser can only
//! run it through a `DynamicsCompressorNode`, set by [`agc_compressor`] from
//! that node's own curve so the two land on the same law.
//!
//! What it is tuned to is what operators hear and what MorseRunner — the
//! benchmark contesters train on — does with its AGC on:
//!
//! - Under a keyed station the band's hiss sits a steady 3 to 5 dB down, from
//!   the first element of the over to the last. No swell at the start, no
//!   pumping between elements: the hang carries the gain across the gaps.
//! - In a long pause the hiss is audibly back.
//! - A crash pulls the gain for a moment and lets go; it does not dig a hole
//!   in the band for the next second.
//!
//! An earlier version learned the band's level over a second and a half, and
//! learned the station with it: every over started 8 dB ducked and swelled up
//! as the receiver got used to it, and every crash left the floor sagging for
//! most of a second. Real AGC-off recordings show neither, and no AGC with a
//! fixed reference can produce the first.
