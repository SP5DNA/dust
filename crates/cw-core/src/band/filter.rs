//! The receiver's CW filter: the one thing every sound you hear has passed
//! through.
//!
//! A real CW filter is many poles deep — a crystal ladder in an IF strip, or
//! its DSP equivalent — and its shape is what an operator hears in the noise.
//! Band-limited hiss takes on the filter's pitch and width, and every dit and
//! every crash of static leaves the filter ringing for a moment afterwards.
//! There is no separate "ringing" to add: it is this filter's impulse
//! response, and it gets longer as the filter gets narrower and its skirts
//! steeper.
//!
//! The filter sits where a real one does: before the detector. A superhet's
//! IF filter and an SDR's channel filter are both a low-pass shape moved up in
//! frequency, and the product detector then maps radio frequency onto audio
//! hertz for hertz. So what reaches the ear is a low-pass response translated
//! to the pitch — H(f) = H_LP(f − pitch) — with skirts that are mirror images
//! in hertz either side of the note. Measured off the air (KiwiSDR, Hermes-Lite
//! 2 and contest-station captures of 20 m, and an RTL-SDR with its own
//! filters) the hiss is centred on the note to within a few hertz and the
//! skirts match to 1.00 at −40 dB. An earlier version moved the prototype to
//! the pitch with the audio band-pass transform instead, which is
//! geometrically symmetric: the hiss sat 56 Hz above the note and the upper
//! skirt was twice as wide as the lower one at −40 dB.
//!
//! So that is how it is built: an eight-pole low-pass prototype, Butterworth
//! for [`FilterShape::Sharp`] and Bessel for [`FilterShape::Soft`], cut off so
//! it is 6 dB down half the width either side, its impulse response
//! multiplied by a cosine at the pitch. In partial fractions that is eight
//! resonators side by side, each one pole pair of the translated prototype
//! with a two-tap numerator. The native player runs them here; the browser
//! builds the same ones out of `IIRFilterNode`s from the same coefficients
//! ([`FilterDesign::sections`]).
//!
//! [`FilterShape::Peaked`] is the Sharp filter with a rig's audio peak filter
//! after it, folded into the same prototype as one more real pole and a zero:
//! a ninth resonator. It is what makes the hiss ring at the note the way it
//! does on a receiver with the APF switched in.
//!
//! The width is the full width between the 6 dB points, for every shape,
//! because that is how a rig's CW filter is quoted: a "300 Hz filter" is
//! 300 Hz wide at 6 dB, and only about 280 Hz wide at 3 dB.
