//! The native player's mixer: no devices, no streams, just the arithmetic
//! that turns a band and a send into samples. Kept apart from the cpal glue
//! so every part of it can be tested on a machine with no sound card.
//!
//! Everything the receiver plays is worked out here, a sample at a time and
//! in one place, as one receiver would: the send through the filter, the
//! band, the AGC hearing the two together and riding both, bands handing
//! over to each other. The output stage — the paddle's sidetone, and the
//! limiter on the lot — is added by the stream, which runs it even when the
//! UI holds the mixer for a moment.
