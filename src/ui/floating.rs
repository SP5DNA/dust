//! The floating window: the stream's groups over whatever else is on screen.
//!
//! A small window of its own, see-through where the desktop allows it, so the
//! groups can be checked while you work in another program. It is desktop
//! only: a browser tab and a phone app cannot put anything over other
//! programs.
//!
//! It has no title bar, and it does not try to keep itself on top: a Wayland
//! client cannot, and a window that asked would be at the mercy of whichever
//! window had focus. The desktop already has the control for it — Always on
//! Top on GNOME, Keep Above Others on KDE — in the window's menu, and a
//! right-click opens that menu without a title bar to hold it. A window put
//! there by the user stays there whatever happens to the main one. Dragging
//! it moves it.
//!
//! The two windows are separate virtual DOMs, and a signal of one does not
//! wake the other. So the main window writes what is to be shown into a
//! plain shared [`Feed`], and the floating one looks at it a few times a
//! second. It holds the feed weakly: once the main window is gone, so is the
//! feed, and the floating window closes itself rather than keep the app
//! running with nothing behind it.
//!
//! Locked, the window lets every click through to whatever is under it, so
//! it can sit over the program you are working in. It cannot be clicked
//! then, so it is unlocked from the main window.
