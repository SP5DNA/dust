//! The guided setup: a first session, then the settings that matter most when
//! starting out, one step at a time, with the control to press pointed at on
//! the page.
//!
//! It starts where a learner does, on the practice screen: start a session,
//! copy one group, discard the session, and go to Settings. Those steps move
//! on by themselves once they are done, as doing them is what takes you to
//! the screen the next one is on. On Settings every step is a few moves —
//! Random, Min 15, Max 25 — and each move knows whether the settings show it
//! made already. So the guide follows whatever is done with the real
//! controls: it ticks a move off however it was made, and points at the next.
//!
//! Show me makes the moves still to make, one at a time and pointing at each
//! first, through the same calls the controls make: it presses Start
//! training, types the group it heard into the box the way a keyed letter
//! goes in, discards the session, and sets each setting as its control does.
//!
//! It points by the ids the controls carry already ([`control_id`]), in a
//! style rule of its own, and needs nothing from the screens.
