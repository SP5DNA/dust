//! The desktop's own menu for a window, opened without a title bar.
//!
//! A window's menu — Always on Top, Move, Close and the rest — belongs to the
//! desktop, and a title bar is only one way in. GTK can ask for it from
//! anywhere in the window: on Wayland that is `xdg_toplevel.show_window_menu`,
//! the request a client makes to have the compositor show the menu its title
//! bar would, and on X11 the `_GTK_SHOW_WINDOW_MENU` message GNOME and KDE
//! both answer. The desktop then keeps the window wherever the user puts it.
//!
//! Elsewhere there is no such menu to ask for, so the window keeps itself on
//! top, which Windows and macOS let an app do.
