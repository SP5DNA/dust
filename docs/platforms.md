# Platform notes

The parts of building, shipping and storing that are specific to one target.
Everything else is in the [README](../README.md).

## Android

Dioxus's `mobile` feature is the same wry/tao webview stack as the desktop
build, so the whole UI, curriculum and scoring come across unchanged. `dx`
enables that feature itself for `--platform android`.

Audio has full parity with the desktop app: `src/audio/native.rs` is compiled
as-is, with cpal routing it to AAudio through
[oboe](https://github.com/google/oboe) instead of ALSA. Building it compiles
oboe's C++ with the NDK toolchain, which is why an NDK is needed and not just
the SDK.

The Morse, the band noise and static, and the paddle sidetone are mixed into
one output stream, so there is no second stream for a device to refuse — some
Android devices will not open two at once.

If a toolchain bring-up ever blocks on oboe, `--features mobile-silent` builds
the same app with a player that keeps a session's timing but makes no sound,
and the practice screen says so.

### Building an APK

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android
export ANDROID_HOME=~/Android/Sdk          # or /usr/lib/android-sdk
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME="$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/27.2.12479018"
dx bundle --platform android --target aarch64-linux-android --package-types apk --release
```

Pass `--target` explicitly: without it `dx` builds for the host architecture,
which on an x86_64 machine means an emulator APK that a phone will not run.

On Debian the `google-android-*-installer` packages in contrib fetch Google's
SDK bits; the official `commandlinetools` zip plus `sdkmanager` gives tighter
control over NDK versions. Either way you need JDK 17 and
`ANDROID_HOME`/`ANDROID_NDK_HOME` exported.

Without cutting a release: **Actions → Android APK → Run workflow**, on any
branch. The APK is attached to that run as an artifact.

### Play Store

Play wants an **Android App Bundle** (`.aab`) signed with an upload key,
targeting API 36. The keystore lives outside the repo
(`~/.android/dust-play-upload.jks`) so it is never committed.

One-time, create the upload key — keep the env file private, since losing the
key means a Play Console upload-key reset:

```bash
install -m 700 -d ~/.android
pw="$(openssl rand -base64 32)"
printf 'KEYSTORE_PASSWORD=%s\nKEY_PASSWORD=%s\n' "$pw" "$pw" > ~/.android/dust-play-upload.env
chmod 600 ~/.android/dust-play-upload.env
# shellcheck disable=SC1090
source ~/.android/dust-play-upload.env
keytool -genkeypair -v \
  -keystore ~/.android/dust-play-upload.jks \
  -storetype JKS \
  -alias upload \
  -keyalg RSA -keysize 4096 -validity 10000 \
  -dname "CN=Dust Morse Trainer, O=Dust, C=US" \
  -storepass "$KEYSTORE_PASSWORD" \
  -keypass "$KEY_PASSWORD"
chmod 600 ~/.android/dust-play-upload.jks
unset pw KEYSTORE_PASSWORD KEY_PASSWORD
```

Then, with a JDK that includes `javac` (17 or 21) and a writable SDK:

```bash
scripts/android-play-bundle.sh
```

That writes `dist/dust-<version>-android-arm64.aab` (`dev.dust.morse`). In Play
Console create the app, let Google generate the app signing key, and upload that
AAB. Back up `~/.android/dust-play-upload.jks` and the env file beside it. The
public upload certificate is `dist/dust-upload-certificate.pem`.

## iOS

Same story as Android — `mobile` is the wry/tao webview stack and cpal reaches
CoreAudio. One thing is iOS-only: an app that has not claimed an
`AVAudioSession` is silent, follows the ringer switch and gets interrupted by
anything else on the device, and cpal does not claim one. The player takes the
`playback` category before opening its first stream.

What you can build, and what Apple lets you install, are different questions:

| | Signing | Runs on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Simulator build | none | a Mac |
| **Unsigned IPA** (this repo) | none | your iPhone, after a sideloader re-signs it |
| Signed IPA / TestFlight | Apple Developer Program, $99/yr | any device, no re-signing |

Releases carry the unsigned `.ipa`, and **Actions → iOS IPA → Run workflow**
builds one from any branch in between. Install it with
[AltStore](https://altstore.io), [SideStore](https://sidestore.io) or
[Sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io): they re-sign the app with your own Apple
ID. A free Apple ID gives a signature that lasts **7 days** and allows **three**
sideloaded apps at a time — the tools re-sign in place before it expires. A paid
membership removes both limits and is the only route to TestFlight or the App
Store.

CI type-checks the simulator target on every PR, which needs no Apple account
and covers the audio-session code and cpal's CoreAudio backend.

## Desktop bundles

`dx bundle --platform desktop --release` writes to
`target/dx/dust/release/linux/` and friends. Desktop is the system webview
(WebKitGTK on Linux, WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS). macOS builds
are unsigned (right-click → Open the first time). Windows needs WebView2,
already present on typical Windows 10/11.

### Copying while you work in other programs

Listen → **Stream groups** keeps sending groups with the window minimised or
behind others. **Floating window** opens a small frameless window, kept above
every other window, that shows each group after it is sent, with its speed
and the few before it. Drag it anywhere; × closes it, and closing the main
window closes it too. **Lock floating window** makes it click-through: every
click goes to the program underneath, so it can sit over your work. A locked
window cannot be clicked, so unlock or close it from the main window.

On Linux the app runs through X11 (XWayland on a Wayland desktop), where
"always on top" and the see-through background are honoured by GNOME, KDE and
the other common window managers. Without a compositor the background is
drawn solid.

## Where your progress lives

Nothing syncs. Each install keeps its own history, in the place that platform
gives it:

| Build | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Web | `localStorage` for that exact origin (`https://mashu.github.io`, or `localhost:8080` while developing — the two are separate stores) |
| Linux | `~/.local/share/dust/` (`$XDG_DATA_HOME`) |
| Windows / macOS | the platform data dir `dirs` reports |
| Android | `/data/data/<package>/files/dust/` — `dirs` has no `HOME` to work from, so the store resolves the package name from `/proc/self/cmdline` |
| iOS | `Library/Application Support/dust/` inside the app container |

`DUST_DATA_DIR` overrides the directory on every desktop and mobile build,
which is what a portable install uses.

Updating the app does not clear any of it. The storage keys (`dust_settings`,
`dust_sessions`, `dust_auto_adjust_*`) and file names are not versioned, and
settings files from older builds still load — new fields fall back to their
defaults, and one unreadable field costs only that field. A history that
cannot be read at all is set aside beside the new one rather than written over,
and if it cannot even be moved, nothing is saved over it.

The history keeps your newest 500 sessions. A browser also gives each site only
a few megabytes; should the history outgrow that — hundreds of sessions of
hundreds of groups — the newest that fit are kept, and the app says so.

Stats are computed across your whole history. Changing course — Koch to Mixed,
a new sequence, a custom alphabet — does not hide what you already did:
accuracy over time, letter mastery, mistakes, the calendar and the streak all
count every session, because a letter is the same letter whichever set it was
sent under. The one exception is the **Sampling** tab, which shows what the
trainer will draw next and so narrows to the current character set, the same way
the sampler itself does.
