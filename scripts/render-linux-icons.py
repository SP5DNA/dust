"""Scale assets/icon.png into the hicolor sizes GNOME actually looks up.

The shell resolves a launcher icon only from directories named in
hicolor's index.theme. A size that is not listed there — the Dioxus
fallback is 460 — never appears. Several of the listed directories are
Threshold, so they will not scale a 512 master down to a menu icon.
